# useReq/req (0.0.22)

The `req` script provides CLI prompts for requirements-driven software.
The prompts defined are exposed as `req.<name>` commands inside various CLIs and Agents.
This allows them to be run both as a Python package (installed as `req`,`usereq` or `use-req`) and directly using `uvx`.


## Feature Highlights
- Create a common interface for different CLIs and Agents.
- Create requirements files for existing projects.
- Manage requirements files in different languages.
- Drive development by requirement changes:
  | Prompt | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `change` | Update the requirements and implement the corresponding changes |
  | `check` | Run the requirements check |
  | `cover` | Implement changes needed to cover the new requirements |
  | `fix` | Fix a defect without changing the requirements |
  | `new` | Implement a new requirement and make the corresponding source code changes |
  | `optimize` | Perform an optimization without changing the requirements |
  | `write` | Write a requirement draft from the standard template |
 


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Use supported environments: `linux`
- Install the `uv` tool from: [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)


### Run useReq/req live with uvx
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/Ogekuri/useReq.git req \
  --base myproject/ \
  --doc myproject/docs/ \
  --dir myproject/tech_docs/ \
  --verbose --debug
```
### Install/Uninstall useReq/req with uv

#### Install
```bash
uv tool install usereq --force --from git+https://github.com/Ogekuri/useReq.git
```

#### Uninstall
```bash
uv tool uninstall usereq
```

### Usage hints
- Run `req` to create/re-create `.codex`, `.github`, `.gemini`, `.kiro`, and `.req` in your project repository.
  - Launch `req` from your home directory (or wherever you prefer) and specify `--base <project-folder>` or `--here` to use the current directory as the project base.
  - `--doc` must be an existing directory under the project base and **shall** contain requirements `.md` files.  If such a file does not exist, it is automatically created from the `requirements.md` template.
  - `--dir` must be an existing directory under the project base and **can** contain technical folders.
- You need to run `req` again if you add/remove requirements files `.md` in the `docs/` directory or any subfolders in the `tech/` directory.
- Add `--verbose` and `--debug` to get detailed and diagnostic output.
