description: "Write a REFERENCES.md using the project's source code"
argument-hint: "No arguments utilized by the prompt logic"
usage: >
  Select this prompt ONLY for docs-maintenance of %%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md: when that file is missing/outdated and you need to regenerate the repository navigation/index from evidence (entrypoints, modules, dependencies) and commit that doc change. Do NOT select if any other file (requirements, workflow, source, tests) must change; use /req-change, /req-new, /req-fix, /req-refactor, /req-cover, /req-implement, /req-create, or /req-recreate for those workflows. Do NOT select for read-only analysis/audits (use /req-analyze or /req-check).

# Write a REFERENCES.md using the project's source code

## Purpose
Maintain a machine-usable reference index (`%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md`) derived from repository evidence so downstream LLM Agents can quickly discover entrypoints, modules, dependencies, and other navigational anchors during SRS-driven work.

## Scope
In scope: generate/update only `%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md` in English (following the prompt’s `req --references` workflow) and commit that doc change. Out of scope: changes to requirements, workflow docs, source code, or tests.

## Professional Personas
- **Act as a Senior System Engineer** when analyzing source code and directory structures to understand the system's architecture and logic.
- **Act as a Technical Writer** when producing the final reference index, ensuring clarity, technical precision, and structured formatting.
- **Act as an Expert GitOps Engineer** when executing git workflows, especially when creating/removing/managing git worktrees to isolate changes safely.

## Pre-requisite: Execution Context
- Generate <EXECUTION_ID> from the current date/time (NOT UUID) to keep date traceability in worktree and branch names by executing `date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`.
- Identify the current git branch with `git branch --show-current` and refer to it as <ORIGINAL_BRANCH>.
- Identify the Git project name with `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` and refer to it as <PROJECT_NAME>.


## Absolute Rules, Non-Negotiable
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER write, modify, edit, or delete files outside of the active git worktree directory, except under `/tmp`, and except for creating/removing the dedicated worktree directory `../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>` as explicitly required by this workflow.
- You can read, write, or edit `%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md`.
- Treat running the test suite as safe. Any files created solely as test artifacts should be considered acceptable because they are always confined to temporary or ignored directories and do not alter existing project files. All file operations executed by tests are restricted to temporary or cache directories (e.g., `tmp/`, `temp/`, `.cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `node_modules/.cache`, `/tmp`); when generating new test cases, strictly adhere to this rule and ensure all write operations use these specific directories.
- **CRITICAL**: Do not modify any project files except creating/updating `%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md`.
- **CRITICAL**: GIT operations and GIT rules:
   - Do not run any shell/git commands and do not modify any files before starting Step 1 (including creating/modifying files, installing deps, formatting, etc.): **CRITICAL**: Check GIT Status.
   - Step 1 may run only the git commands `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, `git rev-parse --verify HEAD`, `git status --porcelain`, and `git symbolic-ref -q HEAD` (plus minimal shell built-ins to combine their outputs into a single cleanliness check).
   - If the repository is NOT clean (modified files, staged changes, OR untracked files), exit immediately without changing anything.
   - At the end you MUST commit only the intended changes with a unique identifier and change description in the commit message.
   - Leave the working tree AND index clean (git `status --porcelain` must be empty).
   - Do NOT “fix” a dirty repo by force (no `git reset --hard`, no `git clean -fd`, no stash) unless explicitly requested. If dirty: abort.

## Behavior
- Do not perform unrelated edits.
- If `.venv/bin/python` exists in the project root, use it for Python executions (e.g., `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m pytest`, `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m <program name>`). Non-Python tooling should use the project's standard commands.
- Use filesystem/shell tools to read/write/delete files as needed (e.g., `cat`, `sed`, `perl -pi`, `printf > file`, `rm -f`, ...), but only to read project files and to write/update `%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md`. Avoid in-place edits on any other path. Prefer read-only commands for analysis.


## Execution Protocol (Global vs Local)
You must manage the execution flow using two distinct methods:
-  **Global Roadmap** (*check-list*): 
   - You MUST maintain a *check-list* internally with `6` Steps (one item per Step).
   - **Do NOT** use the *task-list tool* for this high-level roadmap.
-  **Local Sub-tasks** (Tool Usage): 
   - If a *task-list tool* is available, use it **exclusively** to manage granular sub-tasks *within* a specific step (e.g., in Step X: "1. Edit file A", "2. Edit file B"; or in Step Y: "1. Fix test K", "2. Fix test L").
   - Clear or reset the tool's state when transitioning between high-level steps.

## Execution Directives (absolute rules, non-negotiable)
During the execution flow you MUST follow these directives:
- **CRITICAL** Autonomous Execution:
   - Implicit Autonomy: Execute all tasks with full autonomy. Do not request permission, confirmation, or feedback. Make executive decisions based on logic and technical best practices.
   - Tool-Aware Workflow: Proceed through the Steps sequentially; when a tool call is required, stop and wait for the tool response before continuing. Never fabricate tool outputs or tool results. Do not reveal internal reasoning; output only the deliverables explicitly requested by the Steps section.
   - Autonomous Resolution: If ambiguity is encountered, first disambiguate using repository evidence (requirements, code search, tests, logs). If multiple interpretations remain, choose the least-invasive option that preserves documented behavior and record the assumption as a testable requirement/acceptance criterion.
   - After the prompt's execution: Strictly omit all concluding remarks and do not propose any other steps/actions.
- **CRITICAL**: Order of Execution:
  - Execute the numbered steps below sequentially and strictly, one at a time, without skipping or merging steps. Create and maintain a *check-list* internally while executing the Steps. Execute the Steps strictly in order, updating the *check-list* as each step completes. 
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate start and never stop:
  - Complete all Steps in order; you may pause only to perform required tool calls and to wait for their responses. Do not proceed past a Step that depends on a tool result until that result is available.
  - Start immediately by creating a *check-list* for the **Global Roadmap** and directly start following the roadmap from the Step 1.


## Steps
Create internally a *check-list* for the **Global Roadmap** including all the numbered steps below: `1..6`, and start following the roadmap at the same time, executing the tool call of Step 1 (Check GIT Status). If a tool call is required in Step 1, invoke it immediately; otherwise proceed to Step 1 without additional commentary. Do not add extra intent-adjustment checks unless explicitly listed in the Steps section.
1. **CRITICAL**: Check GIT Status
   - Check GIT status. Confirm you are inside a clean git repo by executing `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1 && test -z "$(git status --porcelain)" && { git symbolic-ref -q HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1 || git rev-parse --verify HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1; } || { printf '%s\n' 'ERROR: Git status unclear!'; }`. If it prints any text containing the word "ERROR", OUTPUT exactly "ERROR: Git status unclear!", and then terminate the execution.
2. **CRITICAL**: Worktree Generation & Isolation
   - Generate <EXECUTION_ID> from the current date/time (NOT UUID) to keep date traceability in worktree and branch names by executing `date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`.
   - Identify the current git branch with `git branch --show-current` and refer to it as <ORIGINAL_BRANCH>.
   - Identify the Git project name with `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` and refer to it as <PROJECT_NAME>.
   - Create a dedicated worktree OUTSIDE the current repository directory to isolate changes:
      - Execute: `git worktree add ../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID> -b useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>`
      - If `.gitignore` excludes `.req/config.json`, copy `.req/config.json` into the new worktree before continuing:
         - `if git check-ignore -q .req/config.json && [ -f .req/config.json ]; then mkdir -p ../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>/.req && cp .req/config.json ../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>/.req/config.json; fi`
   - Move into the worktree directory and perform ALL subsequent steps from there:
      - `cd ../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>`
3. Update `%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md` references file
   -  Create/update the references file with `req --here --references >"%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md"`
4. **CRITICAL**: Stage & commit
   - Show a summary of changes with `git diff` and `git diff --stat`.
   - Stage changes explicitly (prefer targeted add; avoid `git add -A` if it may include unintended files): `git add <file...>` (ensure to include only `%%DOC_PATH%%/REFERENCES.md`).
   - Ensure there is something to commit with: `git diff --cached --quiet && echo "Nothing to commit. Aborting."`. If command output contains "Aborting", OUTPUT exactly "No changes to commit.", and then terminate the execution.
   - Commit a structured commit message with: `git commit -m "docs(<COMPONENT>)<BREAKING>: <DESCRIPTION> [useReq]"`
      - Set `<COMPONENT>` to the most specific component, module, or function affected. If multiple areas are touched, choose the primary one. If you cannot identify a unique component, use `core`.
      - Set `<DESCRIPTION>` to a short, clear summary in **English language** of what changed, including (when applicable) updates to: requirements/specs, source code, tests. Use present tense, avoid vague wording, and keep it under ~80 characters if possible.
      - Set `<BREAKING>` to `!` if a breaking change was implemented (a modification to an API, library, or system that breaks backward compatibility, causing dependent client applications or code to fail or behave incorrectly), set empty otherwise.
      - Include main features added, requirements changes, or a bug-fix description adding a multi-line comment (maximum 10 lines).
         - Do not include the 'Co-authored-by' trailer or any AI attribution.
   - Confirm the repo is clean with `git status --porcelain`. If it is NOT empty, override the final line with EXACTLY "WARNING: References request completed with unclean git repository!".
5. **CRITICAL**: Merge Conflict Management
   - Return to the original repository directory (the sibling directory of the worktree). After working in `../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>`, return with: `cd ../<PROJECT_NAME>`
   - Ensure you are on <ORIGINAL_BRANCH>: `git checkout <ORIGINAL_BRANCH>`
   - If `.gitignore` excludes `.req/config.json`, remove the copied `.req/config.json` from the worktree before merge:
      - `if git check-ignore -q .req/config.json; then rm -f ../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>/.req/config.json; fi`
   - Merge the isolated branch into <ORIGINAL_BRANCH>: `git merge useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>`
   - If the merge completes successfully, remove the worktree directory with force and delete the isolated branch: `git worktree remove ../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID> --force && git branch -D useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID>`
   - Immediately before proceeding to the next step, verify effective deletion of the worktree directory and isolated branch: `test ! -d ../useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID> && ! git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/useReq-<PROJECT_NAME>-<ORIGINAL_BRANCH>-<EXECUTION_ID> || { printf '%s\n' 'ERROR: Worktree cleanup verification failed!'; }`
   - If the verification command prints any text containing the word "ERROR", OUTPUT exactly "ERROR: Worktree cleanup verification failed!", and then terminate the execution.
   - If the merge fails or results in conflicts, do NOT remove the worktree directory and override the final line with EXACTLY "WARNING: References request completed with merge conflicting!".
6. Present results
   - PRINT, in the response, the results in a clear, structured format suitable for analytical processing (lists of findings, file paths, and concise evidence). Use the fixed report schema: ## **Outcome**, ## **Requirement Delta**, ## **Design Delta**, ## **Implementation Delta**, ## **Verification Delta**, ## **Evidence**, ## **Assumptions**, ## **Next Workflow**. Final line MUST be exactly: STATUS: OK or STATUS: ERROR.
