**Context Bootstrap & Persistence (MUST RUN FIRST, EVERY INVOCATION)**:
   - Ensure the directory `.req/context/` exists.
   - **Check for STOP**: If `.req/context/state.md` exists AND `%%ARGS%%` (case-insensitive, after trimming leading/trailing whitespace) is EXACTLY one of: `stop`, `break`, `exit`, `quit`:
     - DELETE the following files if they exist (do not error if missing): `.req/context/active_request.md`, `.req/context/state.md`, `.req/context/pending_proposal.md`, `.req/context/approved_proposal.md`.
     - After file's deletion, OUTPUT exactly "Prompt stopped!" as the FINAL line. The FINAL line MUST be plain text (no markdown/code block) and MUST have no trailing spaces. Terminate response immediately after task completion suppressing all conversational closings (does not propose any other steps/actions, ensure strictly no other text, conversational filler, or formatting follows FINAL line).
   - **Check for Approval**: If `.req/context/state.md` exists AND `%%ARGS%%` (case-insensitive, after trimming leading/trailing whitespace) is EXACTLY one of: `ok`, `proceed`, `approved`, `continue`:
     - Do NOT overwrite `.req/context/active_request.md`.
     - If `.req/context/pending_proposal.md` is missing or empty, instruct the user to rerun the workflow from the beginning (or run `req.reset`) and STOP.
     - DELETE file `.req/context/pending_proposal.md` if exists.
     - COPY file `.req/context/pending_proposal.md` to `.req/context/approved_proposal.md` (overwrite if it exists). Then continue by reading `.req/context/approved_proposal.md` as the implementation source of truth.
     - DELETE file `.req/context/pending_proposal.md`.
     - READ file `.req/context/approved_proposal.md` to restore the technical details of the latest saved proposal. Consider it approved.
     - READ file `.req/context/active_request.md` to fully restore the original request context.
     - READ file `.req/context/state.md` and extract the target phase from the exact line `NEXT-PHASE=<PHASE>`.
     - **CRITICAL - JUMP INSTRUCTION**: Locate a line that contains the exact substring : "**NOTE**: Here start <PHASE>" (case-sensitive). YOU MUST IGNORE ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND NUMBERED STEPS between the end of Step 1 and that note line. Jump directly to that note line and execute only the steps following it (target step). The "Behavior" section remains fully in force. When jumping, create a TODO list only for the remaining steps starting at the target step (use the todo tool if available; otherwise include it in the response), then execute them strictly.
   - **Check for Adjust Proposal**: If `.req/context/state.md` exists AND `$ARGUMENTS` contains non-empty text AND `$ARGUMENTS` is NOT an approval message:
     - APPEND `%%ARGS%%` to `.req/context/active_request.md` with this prefix: "Complete proposal according to this additional information: ".
     - READ file `.req/context/pending_proposal.md` to restore the technical details of the latest saved proposal, if it exists.
     - READ file `.req/context/active_request.md` to fully restore the original request context.
     - READ file `.req/context/state.md` and extract the target phase from the exact line `PREVIOUS-PHASE=<PHASE>`.
     - **CRITICAL - JUMP INSTRUCTION**: Locate a line that contains the exact substring : "**NOTE**: Here start <PHASE>" (case-sensitive). YOU MUST IGNORE ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND NUMBERED STEPS between the end of Step 1 and that note line. Jump directly to that note line and execute only the steps following it (target step).

   - **Check for Adjust Request**: If `.req/context/state.md` NOT exists AND `.req/context/active_request.md` exist AND `%%ARGS%%` contains non-empty text:
     - APPEND `%%ARGS%%` to `.req/context/active_request.md` with this prefix: "Adjust request according to this additional information: ".
     - READ file `.req/context/active_request.md` to fully restore the original request context.
   - **New Request Handling**: If `.req/context/active_request.md` NOT exists AND `%%ARGS%%` contains non-empty text:
     - SAVE it immediately to `.req/context/active_request.md` overwriting existing content.
     - DELETE file `.req/context/state.md`, if it exists.
     - DELETE file `.req/context/pending_proposal.md`, if it exists.
     - DELETE file `.req/context/approved_proposal.md`, if it exists.
   - **Context Restoration (No Arguments)**: If `.req/context/active_request.md` exists AND `%%ARGS%%` is empty:
     - READ file `.req/context/active_request.md` to fully restore the original request context.
     - READ file `.req/context/approved_proposal.md` to restore the technical details of the latest approved proposal, if it exists.
     - If `.req/context/state.md` exists:
       - READ file `.req/context/state.md` and extract the target phase from the exact line `PREVIOUS-PHASE=<PHASE>`.

   - From this point onward:
     - `.req/context/active_request.md` is the source of truth for user intent.
     - `.req/context/pending_proposal.md` is the proposal awaiting approval (may be overwritten by a newer proposal).
     - `.req/context/approved_proposal.md` is the last explicitly approved proposal and MUST NOT be overwritten except when creating a new approved snapshot.
