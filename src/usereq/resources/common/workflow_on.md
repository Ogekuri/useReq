If WORKFLOW.md file exists, analyze the recently implemented code changes, identify new features and behavioral updates, then update WORKFLOW.md by adding or editing only concise bullet lists that accurately reflect the implemented functionality (no verbosity, no unverified assumptions, preserve the existing style and structure). If no changes detected, leave WORKFLOW.md unchanged.
