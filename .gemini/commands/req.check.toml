# Run the requirements check

## Purpose
- Perform the requirements check and report whether all items are correctly covered without making any changes.
 
## Behavior
 - Do not modify any files in the project.
 - Only analyze the code and present the results; make no changes.
 - Report facts: for each finding include file paths and, when useful, line numbers or short code excerpts.
 - Where unit tests exist, strictly adhere to the associated specific instructions.
 - Follow the ordered steps below exactly.

## Steps
Create and execute a TODO list following these steps strictly:
1. Read the file [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) and verify that the project's source code satisfies the requirements listed there.
   - For each requirement, report `OK` if satisfied or `FAIL` if not.
   - For every `FAIL`, provide evidence: file path(s), line numbers (when relevant), and a short explanation.
2. If the technical document [tech/](tech/) exists, read it and verify that the application's code follows that documentation.
   - Report any discrepancies with file paths and concise explanations.
3. Run all available unit tests and provide a summary of the results, highlighting any failures, but do not modify the existing test suite in any way. The unit tests must remain exactly as they are.
4. Present results in a clear, structured way so an analytical system can process them without inferring intent.
