# Update the requirements and implement the corresponding changes

## Purpose
- Produce a clear change proposal and apply the approved changes to the requirements and source code.

## Behavior
 - Propose changes based only on the requirements, user's request and project's source code.
 - Use technical documents to implement features and changes.
 - Preserve the original language of documents, comments, and printed output.
 - Do not make unrelated edits.
 - Follow the ordered steps below exactly.

## Steps
Create and execute a TODO list following these steps strictly:
1. Read [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md), all source files, and the [User Request](#users-request).
2. Produce a clear change proposal describing the edits to requirements and to source code needed to implement the changes described by the [User Request](#users-request).
3. Present the requirements that will change in [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md).
4. If [tech/](tech/) exists, read it and ensure the proposed code changes conform to that document; adjust the proposal if needed.
5. Wait for approval.
6. Implement the approved changes in the requirements file [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md), following its formatting, language, and the template at [/.req/templates/requirements.md](/.req/templates/requirements.md).
7. Implement the corresponding changes in the source code.
8. Re-read [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) and verify the project's source code satisfies the listed requirements.
   - For each requirement, report `OK` if satisfied or `FAIL` if not.
   - For every `FAIL`, provide evidence: file path(s), line numbers (when relevant), and a short explanation.
9. If [tech/](tech/) exists, verify the application's code follows that document and report discrepancies with file paths and concise explanations.
   - Report any discrepancies with file paths and concise explanations.
10. Present results in a clear, structured format suitable for analytical processing (lists of findings, file paths, and concise evidence).
