# Implement changes needed to cover the new requirements

## Purpose
- Perform the requirements check and report whether all items are correctly covered, then propose a source code change to cover all uncovered requirements.
 
## Behavior
 - Do not modify files that contain requirements.
 - Always strictly respect requirements.
 - Use technical documents to implement features and changes.
 - Preserve the original language of documents, comments, and printed output.
 - Do not make unrelated edits.
 - Always update unit tests according new source code and requirements.
 - Follow the ordered steps below exactly.

## Steps
Create and execute a TODO list following these steps strictly:
1. Read the file [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) and verify that the project's source code satisfies the requirements listed there.
   - For each requirement, report `OK` if satisfied or `UNCOVERED` if not.
   - For every `UNCOVERED`, provide evidence: file path(s), line numbers (when relevant), and a short explanation.
2. Produce a clear change proposal describing edits to the source code that will cover all `UNCOVERED` requirements.
3. Re-read [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) and confirm that no changes are needed in [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md).
4. If [tech/](tech/) exists, read it and ensure the proposed code changes conform to that document; adjust the proposal if needed.
5. Wait for approval.
6. Implement the corresponding changes in the source code.
7. Re-read [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md) and verify the project's source code satisfies the listed requirements.
   - For each requirement, report `OK` if satisfied or `FAIL` if not.
   - For every `FAIL`, provide evidence: file path(s), line numbers (when relevant), and a short explanation.
8. If [tech/](tech/) exists, verify the application's code follows that document and report discrepancies with file paths and concise explanations.
   - Report any discrepancies with file paths and concise explanations.
9. Present results in a clear, structured format suitable for analytical processing (lists of findings, file paths, and concise evidence).
